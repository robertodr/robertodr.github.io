My name is Roberto Di Remigio.
I am a PhD student in [theoretical chemistry] at the University of Troms√∏, Norway.
My current research project is on [continuum solvation models].
I am a developer of [PCMSolver], an application programming interface offering
the [polarizable continuum model] functionality to quantum chemistry codes.
I contribute or have contributed to the development of popular quantum chemistry codes:
[DIRAC], [DALTON], [LSDALTON], [Psi4] and [ReSpect].

I am interested in programming. I usually program in [C++] and [Fortran].
I am trying to bring as much [Python] as possible into the mix.
I have lately discovered [functional programming] and [Haskell]. I am still learning,
but I see a lot of potential in it.

I love to [read] and not only about technical subjects. I try to write [notes]
about what I read as often as possible, mostly to help me not to forget!

Find me on [GitHub] and [GitLab], where much of my programming happens.
I try to keep an up-to-date list of my [current] activities.
